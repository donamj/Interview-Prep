This question looks at your skills, communication skills, and ability to explain complexity to others. A good answer focuses less on information and more on the effectiveness of your teaching style.

This question gauges your work style by defining what unstructured means to you. A good answer relates your workstyle to your position. Are you able to fit into a predefined structure?

**What do you want me to know about you that we haven’t discussed?**

Good answers show extra skills you have that may be beneficial to Google. They will also look for soft skills to see if you have non-technical experiences that benefit their teams.

**What is your favorite Google tool, and how would you improve it?**

This question gauges your knowledge of Google, creativity, and willingness to affect change. A good answer is data-driven but not too technical; be sure to focus on why you want to change something. Remember: it should make people’s lives easier.

**Some of the basic rules of Cultural fit interviews are:**

1. Show interest in the product, and demonstrate an understanding of it. I once had a candidate who told me that Facebook sells cloud services like AWS (Storage/Compute). He had even used one of those. Now, Facebook did buy Parse and kept it alive for a while, but Cloud Infrastructure was never Facebook’s primary/core business.
2. Be ready to describe scenarios where you had a conflict with your teammates or managers and how you resolved it. Please don’t say that you never had a conflict if you’ve been working as a software engineer for a few years.
3. Talk about what you want to accomplish in the company.
4. Talk about some of your recent / most significant accomplishments as an engineer.
5. Talk about some particularly crazy/difficult bugs that you encountered.
