# How to prepare for Google Interview

### Key topics to review: 
1. Be prepared with **complexity** of algorithms and that you can implement a range of data structures using an array (especially hash maps and hash tables). 
2. **Algorithms**: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
3. **Sorting**: Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quick sort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quick sort is impractical, so take a look at it. See geeksforgeeks link above for sorting algorithms reference.
4. **Big-O notation**: also known as "the run time characteristic of an algorithm". You may want to refresh hash tables, heaps, binary trees, linked lists, depth-first search, recursion. http://bigocheatsheet.com/
5. **Hashtables**: Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview. 
6. **Trees**: Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal 
7. **Graphs**: Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.
