# How to track your progress?

I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to track my progress. Here is [template](https://github.com/donamj/Interview-Prep/blob/main/Tracking%20Progress.md) to the method I followed.

There are mainly 4 sections:
1. **Topics** - Add all the topics that you have planned to learn. 
2. **Focus** - Topics planned for this week
3. **Current** - Topics that are currently looked into.
4. **Complete** - Topics completed

Additionally, I had these optional sections:
1. **Company Specific** - Topics to be exclusively learnt for a company.
2. **Must** - A set of must learn topics
3. **Pending** - Some topics that were pending from any week or if I need to have a second look at those. I refer these topics as and when time permits or if I have some extra prep time in a week.

### What I did?
- At the beginning of each week, I moved the topics planned for each week to **Focus** section.
- When a topic was looked into, it was moved to **Current** section.
_ The topics were moved to **Completed** section.

### Labels
I labelled topics planned for each week as *Week_1*, *Week_2*, *Week_3*, *Week_4* and *If_time_premits*. This helped moving the topics to focus section easily in the beginning of the week.
