# Heaps

A Min Heap Binary Tree is commonly represented as an array, which is indexed according to the below format: 

| Node          |Position       |
|----------------|--------------|
| Current Node | arr[i]       |
| Parent Node  | arr[(i-1)/2] |
| Left Child   | arr[2*i + 1] |
| Right Child  | arr[2*i + 2] |
<br />


Time complexities of various min heap operations:

|   Function    |	Time Complexity |
|----------------|--------------|
|   get_min()	|   O(1)            |
|   insert_minheap()	|	O(logN)    |
|   delete_minimum()	|	Same as insert â€“ O(logN)    |
|   heapify()	|	O(logN)    |
|   delete_element()	|	O(logN)    |
