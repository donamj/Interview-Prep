## Points to Note
1. Perfect binary trees should have 2^k-1 nodes, where k is the number of levels 

2. When performed on a binary search tree, it visits the nodes in ascending order (hence the name "in-order").

3. In a pre-order traversal, the root is always the first node visited.

4. In a post-order traversal, the root is always the last node visited.

5. Level order traversal of a tree is breadth first traversal for the tree.

## AVL Tree
The balance factor of node N is height(right(N)) – height(left(N)). In an AVL Tree, the balance factor of a node could be only one of 1, 0, or -1 values.

## Trie
A trie is a tree-like data structure, with nodes that store the letters of an alphabet. Words and strings can be reTRIEved from the structure by traveling down a branch path of the tree.
