REST APIs are based on HTTP requests or verbs, which each perform a different task.

REST supports the following HTTP requests:
* GET method: Request data from server
* POST method: Submit data to create new resource on server-defined URL
* PUT method: Submit data to update a resource at client-defined URL
* DELETE method: Remove resource from server
* OPTIONS method: Return request methods supported by a service
* HEAD method: Return meta information such as response headers
* PATCH method: Modify part of the resource on the server
