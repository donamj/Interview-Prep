1. **Polymorphism** is the ability of a variable, function, or object to take multiple forms. It allows you to define one interface or method and have multiple implementations. Polymorphism is characterized by the method overloading and method overriding.
    - Method Overloading <br>
        Method Overloading is the act of having the same function name but differs in number and type of arguments within the same class.
    - Method Overriding <br>
        Method Overriding is the specific implementation of a method in a child class which is already defined in the parent class.

2. **Abstraction** is a concept of hiding the details and showing only the necessary things to the user. We use an abstract class/Interface to express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation.
	- An Abstract class is a class which is declared with an abstract keyword and cannot be instantiated.
	- An interface is a blueprint that contains static constants and abstract methods.

3. **Inheritance** is a concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps with reusability and establishes a relationship between different classes. The relationship is established in code using the keyword extends.

4. **Encapsulation** is a process of hiding data implementation by restricting access to public methods. The instance variables are kept private and the accessor methods(getters and setters) are made public.
