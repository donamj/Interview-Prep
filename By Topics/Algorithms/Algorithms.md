## Greedy Algorithms
The main advantage of the Greedy method is that it is straightforward, easy to understand and easy to code. In Greedy algorithms, once we make a decision, we do not have to spend time reexamining the already computed values. Its main disadvantage is that for many problems there is no greedy algorithm. That means, in many cases there is no guarantee that making locally optimal improvements in a locally optimal solution gives the optimal global solution. 


**Applications of Greedy algorithms:**
- Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms 
- Shortest path in Weighted Graph [Dijkstra’s] 
- Coin change problem 
- Fractional Knapsack problem 
- Disjoint sets-UNION by size and UNION by height (or rank) 
- Job scheduling algorithm 
- Greedy techniques can be used as an approximation algorithm for complex problems
