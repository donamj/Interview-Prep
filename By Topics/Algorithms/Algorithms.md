# Algorithms

**Dynamic Programming Algorithms:**
<br>
These algorithms solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems. Examples include the Fibonacci series, Knapsack problem, and Bellman-Ford algorithm.

**Greedy Algorithms:**
<br>
These algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage in the hope of finding a global optimum. Examples include Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees and Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

**Divide and Conquer Algorithms:** 
<br>
These algorithms divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and then combine the solutions to solve the original problem. Examples include the Merge Sort algorithm and the QuickSort algorithm.

**Backtracking Algorithms:** 
<br>
These algorithms systematically explore all possible solutions by incrementally building candidates and undoing choices when they are found to be invalid. Examples include the N-Queens problem and the Sudoku-solving algorithm.

## Greedy Algorithms
The main advantage of the Greedy method is that it is straightforward, easy to understand and easy to code. In Greedy algorithms, once we make a decision, we do not have to spend time reexamining the already computed values. Its main disadvantage is that for many problems there is no greedy algorithm. That means, in many cases there is no guarantee that making locally optimal improvements in a locally optimal solution gives the optimal global solution. 


**Applications of Greedy algorithms:**
- Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms 
- Shortest path in Weighted Graph [Dijkstra’s] 
- Coin change problem 
- Fractional Knapsack problem 
- Disjoint sets-UNION by size and UNION by height (or rank) 
- Job scheduling algorithm 
- Greedy techniques can be used as an approximation algorithm for complex problems
